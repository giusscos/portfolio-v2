        I'm Giuseppe, a web and mobile freelance developer with over 2 years of professional experience. I'm specialized
        in
        front-end development using <b>Vue.js, Nuxt.js, Swift, React, and React Native</b>. On the back end, I primarily
        use Laravel (PHP) and am currently exploring serverless solutions like <b>Supabase</b>, which I find highly
        promising.
        <br>
        I'm open to exciting collaborations and forward-thinking projects ðŸš€
